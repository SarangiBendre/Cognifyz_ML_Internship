# Cognifyz_ML_Internship

This repository contains machine learning tasks completed as part of the Machine Learning Internship at Cognifyz Technologies.

The projects are based on a real-world restaurant dataset provided by the company and focus on applying core machine learning concepts such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, regression, classification, and recommendation systems.

## Tasks Included
- Restaurant Rating Prediction using regression models
- Restaurant Recommendation System using content-based filtering
- Cuisine Classification using supervised learning algorithms

Each task is implemented with clear problem statements, well-structured Jupyter notebooks, proper evaluation metrics, and original explanations.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

This repository demonstrates practical machine learning skills and end-to-end project implementation.
